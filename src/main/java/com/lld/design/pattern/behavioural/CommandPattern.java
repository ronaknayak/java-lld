/**
 * The Command design pattern decouples the sender of a request from the receiver, providing a way
 * to issue commands without knowing the specific operation that will be performed or the receiver
 * of the request.
 * <p>
 * Use cases:
 * <p>
 * 1. Job scheduling
 * Command objects can be utilized in job scheduling systems. Each job or task to be executed is
 * encapsulated as a command object, which contains all the necessary information and logic to
 * perform the task. The job scheduler maintains a queue of command objects and executes them
 * based on predefined criteria, such as priority, time, or dependencies.
 * <p>
 * 2. You want to group a set of operations as a single unit - batch jobs
